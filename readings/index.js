      'We often think of history as something lived by those before us, yet each day we experience is also part of history. Nexus brilliantly reflects this, offering a fascinating perspective on the technological advances that have shaped our journey to the present. It questions the scope of artificial intelligence in a compelling way and provides a thought-provoking glimpse into our near future.',

    author: 'Charles Duhigg',
    notes:
      'I can say it’s the best book I’ve read recently. It offers a wonderful perspective on habits, and with its storytelling, it allows you to empathize deeply in many situations. As you read, you begin to question many of your own actions. A true masterpiece.',

    author: 'Jake Knapp & John Zeratsky',
    notes:
      'It turned out to be a great book for me, arriving just when I needed it most, as I felt somewhat adrift. I quickly applied the concepts of focusing and truly creating time to work. Rather than unsustainable suggestions like ‘be ultra-productive, wake up at 5 a.m., and take cold showers,’ this book offered an enjoyable approach centered on focusing on a single goal and reshaping habits to support that focus.',
